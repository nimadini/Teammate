Teammate
========

Teammate is a social network web-app which helps you find your future suitable teammates. [similar to Linked-in] It has done as the final proejct of my Advanced Programming Tools graduate course at the University of Texas at Austin. This project has been chosen as the 1st in class (among 22 teams) in Fall 2014. [I am currently the head TA of this course in Fall 2015]

Please take a look at this youtube video to learn more about my app: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc-WS8Xl2vY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc-WS8Xl2vY)
